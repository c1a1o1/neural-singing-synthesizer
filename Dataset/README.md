# Data set folder
All the data should go in this folder. Please follow the given
guidelines.
1. It should be placed inside a sub-folder with the name of the model.
   e.g: If the name of the model is "Freddy", the sub folder should be
   Dataset/Freddy

2.  The audio clips must be in .wav format

3. Inside the folder an excel file named "index.xlsx" must be place. The
   first column should contain the name of the audio clip (without the
   .wav extension). The second column should contain the lyrics
   corresponding to the audio clip.
